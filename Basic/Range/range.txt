In Go (Golang), the range keyword is used in for-loops to iterate over different data structures such as arrays, slices, maps, strings, and channels.

1. Range with Arrays and Slices

When you use range with an array or slice, it returns two values in each iteration:

index → position of the element

value → the element at that index


2.Range with Maps

When iterating over a map, range returns:

key

value


3. Range with Strings

When using range with a string, it iterates over Unicode code points (runes).


4. Range with Channels

When used with a channel, range iterates over the values received from the channel until it’s closed.
