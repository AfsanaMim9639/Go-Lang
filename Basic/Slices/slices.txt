## What is a Slice?
A slice is a flexible, dynamic view into an array. Unlike arrays (which have a fixed size), slices can grow and shrink. Think of a slice as a lightweight wrapper around an array that gives you more flexibility.
Anatomy of a Slice
## A slice has three components:

1. Pointer: Points to the first element of the underlying array
2. Length: The number of elements in the slice (accessed with len())
3. Capacity: The number of elements in the underlying array from the pointer's position (accessed with cap())
